# OTP Request REST Service


**1. Background**

MOSIP Partner can request an OTP for an individual, which can be used to perform OTP based authentication using OTP Request API for that Individual.

 ***1.1.Target users -***  
MOSIP Partner will request for an OTP on behalf of an Individual


 ***1.2. Key requirements -***   
-	MOSIP Partner can authenticate an Individual using OTP sent to the Individual by OTP Request API
-	MOSIP Partner will capture Individual’s UIN/VID and construct OTP Request
-	Once OTP Request is received, authenticate and authorize TSP
-	Check Individual’s UIN/VID for authenticity and validity
-	Create and send OTP to the Individual via message and/or email

 ***1.3. Key non-functional requirements -***   
<TBD>

**2. Solution**   
OTP Request REST service addresses the above requirement -  

1.	MOSIP Partner to construct a POST request with below details and send to Request URL 
`/idauthentication/v1/otp/` - [Sample Request Body](https://github.com/mosip/mosip/wiki/ID-Authentication-APIs#post-idauthenticationv1otp)
2.	Authenticate and Authorize MOSIP Partner.
3.	Validate “reqTime” for incoming OTP Requests for valid format and timestamp < 20mins from current time
4.	Integrate with kernel UIN Validator and VID Validator to check UIN/VID for validity. Validate UIN/VID for authenticity in AuthDB
5.	Create OTP using OTP key in the format using OtpUtil- <product_id>_<uin_ref_id>_<txn_id>_<mua_code>
6.	Retrieve mode of communication with Individual using admin config to send generated OTP
7.	Integrate with Kernel SmsNotifier and EmailNotifier to send the generated OTP to their stored phone/email respectively.
8.	Respond to MOSIP Partner with [Success response](https://github.com/mosip/mosip/wiki/ID-Authentication-APIs#success-response-2)
