# OTP Request REST Service


**1. Background**

TSP can request an OTP for an individual, which can be used to perform OTP based authentication using OTP Request API for that Individual.

1.1. ***Target users -***  
TSP will request for an OTP on behalf of an Individual


1.2. ***Key requirements -***   
-	TSP can authenticate an Individual using OTP sent to the Individual by OTP Request API
-	TSP will capture Individual’s UIN/VID and construct OTP Request
-	Once OTP Request is received, authenticate and authorize TSP
-	Check Individual’s UIN/VID for authenticity and validity
-	Create and send OTP to the Individual via message and/or email

1.3. ***Key non-functional requirements -***   
<<TBD>>

**2. Solution**   
OTP Request REST service addresses the above requirement -  

1.	TSP to construct a POST request with below details and send to Request URL identity/otp
Sample Request Body – 
```JSON
{
  "id": "mosip.identity.otp",
  "ver": "1.0",
  "indId": "1234567890",
  "indIdType": "D",
  "muaCode": "tspLevel1ID",
  "reqTime": "2018-10-12T09:45:49.565Z",
  "txnID": "txn12345"
}
```

2.	Authenticate and Authorize TSP <<TBD>>
3.	Validate “reqTime” for incoming OTP Requests for valid format and timestamp < 20mins from current time
4.	Integrate with kernel UIN Validator and VID Validator to check UIN/VID for validity. Validate UIN/VID for authenticity in AuthDB
5.	Create OTP using OTP key in the format using OtpUtil- <product_id>_<uin_ref_id>_<txn_id>_<mua_code>
6.	Retrieve mode of communication with Individual using admin config to send generated OTP
7.	Integrate with Kernel SmsNotifier and EmailNotifier to send the generated OTP to their stored phone/email respectively.
8.	Respond to TSP with below success OTP generation response - 
```JSON
{
  "status": true,
  "err": [],
  "resTime": "2018-10-12T09:45:49.580Z",
  "txnID": "txn12345"
}
```

**2.1. Class Diagram**

Below are details on the above classes –
-	***OTPRequestDTO*** – Request object with input request for OTP
-	***OTPResponseDTO*** – Response object with success or failure to generate and send OTP
-	***IDAuthFilter*** – Spring filter to intercept OTP Request and Response in order to authenticate/authorize TSP
-	***OTPController*** – Spring Controller to receive OTP Request
-	***OTPRequestValidator*** – Spring Validator to validate input request object OTPRequestDTO
-	***OTPFacade*** – Sprint Component that acts like facade layer to validate UIN/VID and invoke OTPService to process OTP request
-	***OTPService*** – Spring Service that interacts with OTPManager and OTPUtil to generate OTP
-	***OTPManager*** – Manager class to integrate with Kernel Generate OTP and Validate OTP Rest APIs
-	***OTPUtil*** – Utility class to generate unique key to be used to generate OTP
-	***IDAuthControllerAdvice*** – Spring Controller Advice used to handle all exceptions and send corresponding error response
-	***IDAuthService*** –Spring Service that validates UIN and VID for its authenticity
-	***NotificationService*** – Sprint Service whichwhich is created in another user story and used here to send generated OTP to individual as SMS or Email.
