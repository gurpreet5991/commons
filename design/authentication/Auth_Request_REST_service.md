# Identity Auth REST Service


**1. Background**

Identity Auth REST service can be used to authenticate an Individual. MOSIP supports below types of authentications –
-	Pin based – OTP, Static Pin
-	Demographic based – Name, Address, DOB, Gender, Phone and EmailID
-	Biometric based – Fingerprint, IRIS and Face


 ***1.1.Target users -***  
TSP can use Identity Auth service to authenticate an Individual by using one or more of the above types of authentication supported.


 ***1.2. Key requirements -***   
-	TSP can authenticate an Individual using one or more of the above mentioned authentication types
-	TSP will send Individual’s UIN/VID to enable authentication of Individual
-	TSP will send muaCode and msaCode to authenticate and authorize a TSP to authenticate an Individual
-	Check Individual’s UIN/VID for authenticity and validity
-	Inform authentication status (success/failure) to the Individual in the form of message and/or email  


 ***1.3. Key non-functional requirements -***   
-	Logging :
	-	Log each stage of authentication process
	-	Log all the exceptions along with error code and short error message
	-	As a security measure, Individual’s UIN or PI/PA should not be logged
-	Audit :
	-	Audit all transaction details during authentication process in database
	-	Individual’s UIN or PI/PA details should not be audited
	-	Audit any invalid UIN or VID incidents
-	Exception :
	-	Any failure in authentication/authorization of TSP and validation of UIN and VID needs to be handled with appropriate error code and message in Auth Response
	-	Any error in Individual authentication also should be handled with appropriate error code and message in Auth Response 
-	Security :


**2. Solution**   
Identity Auth REST service addresses the above requirements as explained below. 

1.	TSP to construct a POST request with below details and send to Request URL identity/auth    
Sample Request Body – 
```JSON
{
  "id" : "mosip.identity.auth",
	"ver" : "1.0",	
	"indId" : "1234567890",
	"indIdType" : "V",
	"authType" : 
		{
			"address" : false,
			"fullAddress" : true,
			"personalIdentity" : false,
			"otp" : false,
			"pin" : false,
			"bio" : false
		},
	"muaCode" : "tspLevel1ID",
	"txnID" : "txn12345",
	"reqTime" : "2018-10-17T07:22:57.086+0000",
	"reqHmac" : "<SHA of request element>",
	"key" : "<encrypted_encoded_session_key>",
	"matchInfo" : 
		[
			{ 
				"authType" : "fullAddress",
				"ms" : "P",
				"mt" : 60
			}
		],
        "pinInfo" : 
		{
			"value" : "123456",
			"type" : "OTP"
		},
        "request" : 
	{
		//JSON request as per the id object schema defined by the country
		"identity": {
			"name": [
				{
					"language": "ar",
					"value": "ابراهيم"
				},
				{
					"language": "fr",
					"value": "Ibrahim"
				}
			],
			"addressLine1": [
				{
					"language": "ar",
					"value": "عنوان العينة سطر 1"
				},
				{
					"language": "fr",
					"value": "exemple d'adresse ligne 1"
				}
			],
			"fullAddress": [
				{
					"language": "ar",
					"value": "فاس-الدار البيضاء"
				},
				{
					"language": "fr",
					"value": "Casablanca"
				}
			],
			"leftEye": [
				{
					"value": "encoded_left_eye_image"
				}
			],
			"rightIndex": [
				{
					"value": "encoded_right_index_image"
				}
			]
		}		
	}
}

```

2.	Authenticate and Authorize TSP <<TBD>>
3.	Validate “reqTime” for incoming Identity Auth Requests for valid format and timestamp < 24 hours (configurable value) from current time
4.	Integrate with kernel UIN Validator and VID Validator to check UIN/VID for validity. Validate UIN/VID for authenticity in AuthDB
5.	Once the above validations are successful, Identity Auth request is then validated based on specific authentication types as described below.
	a.	OTP Auth – OTP value sent to the Individuals are validated
	b.	Demo Auth – Input Demo fields are validated against stored Individual’s Demo Fields
	c.	Pin Auth – Static Pin generated by the Individuals is validated against the input pin
	d.	Bio Auth – Fingerprint/IRIS/Face minutiae stored is validated against input bio minutiae
6.	Retrieve mode of communication with Individual using admin config to send authentication success/failure information
7.	When the Individual is successfully authenticated based on one or more of the above authentication types, a sms/email notification is sent to them using Kernel’s SmsNotifier and EmailNotifier to their stored phone/email respectively.
8.	Respond to TSP with below success Identity Auth response - 
```JSON
{
	"status" : true,
	"err": [],
	"txnID": "txn12345",
	"resTime": "2018-10-17T13:40:19.590Z",
	"info": 
	{
            "indIdType": "V",
	    "reqTime": "2018-10-17T07:22:57.086+0000",
	    "ver": "1.0",
	    "matchInfo":
	    [
	    	{
	        	"authType": "fullAddress",
	        	"ms": "P",
	        	"mt": 60
	       	}
	    ],
           "usageData": "0xaf100000af100000"
	  }
}

```

**2.1. Component Diagram**   
Below component diagram shows all the components that work together during authentication process

![Identity Auth Component Diagram](_images/Identity_Auth_Component_Diagram.png)

Below are the details on each of the above components:
-	***IDAuthFilter*** – A Spring Filter to intercept AuthRequest and perform TSP authentication/authorization
-	***AuthController*** – A Spring Controller to process all the types of authentications
-	***AuthValidator*** – A Spring Validator to perform basic validation on AuthRequest
-	***IDAuthControllerAdvice*** – A Spring Controller Advice to handle all IDA exceptions centrally and respond to TSP in the form of AuthResponse
-	***AuthFacade*** – A facade layer decide which authentication service to be invoked based on the auth request
-	***OTPAuthService*** – A Spring Service that contains business logic for authenticating an Individual using otp
-	***DemoAuthService*** – A Spring Service that contains business logic for authenticating an Individual using one or more input demo fields
-	***BioAuthService*** – A Spring Service that contains business logic for authenticating an Individual using one of the supported Bio Auth types like Fingerprint, IRIS and Face
-	***NotificationService*** – A Spring Service to determine what is the notification type associated with the Individual and then send the authentication success/failure notification
-	***IDMasterAuthService*** – A Spring Service that validates UIN and it matching VID
-	***OTPManager*** – A Manager class which integrates with Core-Kernel validator logic to validate input otp value


**2.2. Exception Handling:**   
Below exception hierarchy shows how IDAuthentication will handle exceptions
![Identity Auth Exception Handling Class Diagram](_images/Identity_Auth_Exception_Handling.png)

-	***IDAuthDaoException*** – This exception will wrap all database related exceptions thrown by Dao layer 
-	***IDAuthBusinessException*** – This exception handles all business logic related issues, any business condition not met, issues in communicating with external APIs, etc. It also wraps all IDAuthenticationDaoException
-	***IDAuthAppException*** – This exception class will be thrown by Controller layer and wraps all IDAuthenticationBusinessException and throws only one type of exception to the end user
-	***IDAuthExceptionHandler*** – This is a generic exception handler class which centrally handles exceptions thrown by controller layer and creates a generic response object, which is then sent as the response to the user
-	***IDAuthErrorConstants*** – This is a common error constants class which contains the list of all error codes and error messages used by IDA product.
