# List of role - Service

#### Background

The users and roles are stored in LDAP and this is the single source of truth. In case of offline application, the list of roles should be repliacated to the respective application. This is a replica of the representation in the LDAP server.  

#### Solution



**The key solution considerations are**


- There should be a service which will return the list of roles available in the MOSIP system.


- The service should be secured and the permissions should be provided to a authorized personnel only.


- The service is a wrapper, which will connect to the AuthServer to provide the result.
