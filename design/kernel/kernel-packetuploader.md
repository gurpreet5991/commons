# SFTP Client

#### Background

This library can be used as a SFTP client to upload files/packets to SFTP server. It has series of operations to perform as:

- Creating SFTP channel providing SFTP server details


- Upload files


- Release the connection
 


#### Solution



**The key solution considerations are**


- Create a project which implements SFTP client using SSH connection based on Jcraft JSCH API.


- SFTP Client can be used in any MOSIP module for upload files after adding KeyGenerator implementation to their class path.
