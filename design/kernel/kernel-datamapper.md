## Data Mapper

**Background**


This library can be used to facilitate data mapping between objects. It contain a series of methods that accept following parameters:


-	Source Object


-	Destination Object / Class


-	Mapping Fields to include


-	Fields to exclude


-	Null mapping


-   Default mapping


- 	Data converter



**Solution**



**The key solution considerations are**


- Create an interface for DataMapper and DataConverter having required method declaration, which will be exposed to the other applications.


- Create a project which will have Data Mapper implementation based on Orika API.


- DataMapper can be used in any MOSIP module for encryption and decryption after adding crypto implementation to their class path.
