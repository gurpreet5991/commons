# User Agency ID Generator

#### Background

Each User Agency can have various ids. The IDs are generated by this module. The module will generate a jar file which other project will add in the classpath. 

#### Solution



**The key solution considerations are**


- An unique number have to be generated for each request.

- The various configurations such as the starting number, incremental value, restricted numbers etc., are retrieved from the config server and injected to the library.

- The libary which is generated should be a jar file. This jar file can be used by other modules in their classpah.
