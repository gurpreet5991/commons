# Logger

#### Background

This application can be used to log execution steps and errors with customized messages and format. It has three different options for logging as:


- Console

#### Solution



**The key solution considerations are**


- Create an interface for Logger having required method declaration to provide logging functionalities, which will be exposed to the other applications.


- Create a project which implements Logger based on Logback API.


- Logger can be used in any MOSIP module for for logging after adding KeyGenerator implementation to their class path.
