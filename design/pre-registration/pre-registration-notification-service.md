# Approach for Notification Service

**Background**
- Exposing the REST API to notify via SMS or email to a citizen.

The target users are -
   - Pre-Registration UI

The key requirements -

-   Create the REST API to notify via SMS or email to a citizen while sending any notification. which internally call the kernel notification service.

The key non-functional requirements are

-   Log the each state while sending notification to a citizen:

-   Exception :
    -   Any exception occurred during sending notification, the same will
        be reported to the user with the user understandable exception.

**Solution**

**Notify :**

- Create a REST API as '/notify' POST method which accept the notification details, lang code, document for attachment as a request part parameters.

- notification details contains : name, pre-registration id, appointment date, appointment time, mobile number, email address and additionalRecipient.

- If the additionalRecipient is false then based on the pre-registration id do the REST call to retrieve the pre-registration data, parse the ID JSON object to get the mobile number and email address out of it.

- Do the REST call to retrieve the corresponding language notification templet based on requestd and lang code.

- DO the REST call to the KERNEL notification service based on SMS and Email. If it is successful send the success response otherwise throw an exception.
