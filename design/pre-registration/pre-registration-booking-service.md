# Approach for Pre-Registration Booking Service

**Background**
- Exposing the REST API to book/cancel/modify a appointment for a citizen.

The target users are -
   - Pre-Registration portal

The key requirements are -

-   Create Booking APIs to book an appointment for the selected Registration center and the availability time slot for the Registration center, rebook an appointment, cancel an appointment, retrieve appointment details, retrieve availability for the registration center.

- This above details need to store in a pre-registration database. Once storing the data is completed then system need to update the availability time slots for the particular registration center.

- Once the availability time slots for the particular registration center get updated successfully then an status need to update the pre-registration status as "Booked".

The key non-functional requirements are

-   Log the each state of the pre-registration creation:

    -   As a security measures the Pre-Id or applicant information should not be logged.

-   Audit :

    -   Each state of the Pre-Registration appointment booking should be stored into the Database for audit purpose.

    -   Pre-reg Id and important detail of the applicant should not be audited.

-   Exception :

    -   Any exception occurred during the registration booking, the same will be reported to the user with the user understandable exception.

**Solution**

- Create a REST API as '/appointment/{preRegistrationId}' POST method, which accept the PreRegistrationId as path parameter and in request body json object contains registration center id, booking date, from slot and to slot.

- Check for the pre-registration whether it is existing or not and check for availability slot for the requested details.

- Update the availability by decrementing the value by 1.

- Save the booking data in the pre-registration booking table. after inserting the booking data system need to update the main table (applicant_demographic) with the status code "Booked"

- Audit the exception/start/exit of the each stages of the Pre-registration create mechanism using AuditManager component.
