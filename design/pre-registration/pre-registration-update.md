# Approach for Pre-Registartion demographic and document update

**Background**
-   Expose the API to update the demographic details and supporting document of the citizen for a pre-registration, where the data captured in the pre-registration portal should be update in database.

The target users are -
   - Pre-Registration portal user. 

The key requirements are -
-   Create the REST API to update the pre-registartion form and update document.

-   Demographic form should have the detail of:

    -   Name

    -   Age/DOB

    -   Gender Type

    -   Address

    -   Location details

    -   Contatct details

    -   CINE / PIN number.

- Document should have following type:
     - Proof of Identity

     - Proof of Address

     - Proof of DOB

- Once the demographic data is updated an REST API should get called and get updated in the database.

-  Only "Pending-Appointment" status pre-registation form should allow to update the demographic information and documents.

-  The API should return the success / failure status code along with
    the respective message.

- To update document, it should be a different microservice as per the technical architecture. 

- For each document update it should hit the rest api to delete the existing document in database and store the new document as per the document category.

- Integrating with Pre-Registartion UI client for pre-registration form(demoragphic and document).

The key non-functional requirements are

-   Security :

    -  The Pre-Registartion JSON form should be encrypt and stored in the     pre-registartion database.

-   Log the each state of the pre-registration creation:

    -   As a security measures the Pre-Id or applicant information should
        not be logged.

-   Audit :

    -   Each state of the Pre-Registration creation should be stored into the DB
        for audit purpose.

    -   Pre-reg Id and important detail of the applicant should not be audited.

-   Exception :

    -   Any exception occurred during the pre-registration, the same will
        be reported to the user with the user understandable exception.


Out of Scope

- Key management for encrypting JSON.

- Scanning the uploaded document for virus.

- Document quality checking to meet the threshold acceptence level.

- Encrypting the uploaded document and store it in database.

**Solution**
**Update existing pre-registration :**

-   Create a REST API as '/applications' accept the ID Definition JSON object (#id-definition-structure) from the pre-registration application portal.

- Once all the mandatory fields enter then only "Save" button get enable to call the REST API to create. 

-   Validate the request object against the ID Definition schema and render the respective error message.

-   If the provided request JSON object is valid then continue with the rest
    of the process.

-  To update process, due to performance criteria, get the existing per-registartion entity from database by pre-reg id and delete the entire row by pre-reg id and insert updated data with same pre-reg id.

-  Encrypte the requested JSON and store it in database with pre-registration id from the request object.

-   Audit the exception/start/exit of the each stages of the Pre-registration update mechanism using AuditManager component.


 **Update Document:**

-   Create a REST Service as '/documents' accept the JSON object (#document-json-structure) and a multipart file from the pre-registration application portal..

-   In the document JSON object it should contain the pre-registration id, document id, document type, document category, document format uploaded by and uploaded timestamp.

- 	Following operation need to be happen:

	Step1: Document Virus scanning, if successful go to next step otherwise throw an exception.{will be taken care in the integration user story}
	
	Step2: Document encryption, if successful go to next step otherwise throw an exception.{will be taken care in the integration user story}
	
	Step3: To update the document, get the existing document entity from database by pre-reg id and delete the entire row by pre-reg id and insert updated document with same pre-reg id and document id.

**Success / Error Code**
- While processing the Pre-Registration update if there is any error or successfully then send the respective success or error code to the UI from API layer as  Response object.
