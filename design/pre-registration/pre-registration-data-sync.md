# Approach for Data Sync with Registartion Client

**Background**
- Exposing the API to Registration client will provide with the list of Pre-Registration IDs for which they wants to get Pre-Registration Data.

The target users are -
   - Registration Client 

The key requirements are -
-   Create the REST API to Registration client will provide with the list of Pre-Registration IDs for which it wants to get Pre-Registration Data.

- Pre-Registration will provide a file per Pre-Registration ID consisting of
     - Demographic Data
     - Documents
     - Appointment Time.

- Pre-Registration send zip file per Pre-Registration IDs consisting of Demographic Data, Documents, Appointment Time.

The key non-functional requirements are

-   Security :

    -  The Pre-Registartion securly share the pre-registartion data to registration client.

-   Log the each state of the data sync:

    -   As a security measures the Pre-Id or applicant information should
        not be logged.

-   Audit :

    -   User ID, RC ID, Transaction ID, Timestamp should be stored into the DB
        for audit purpose.

    -   Pre-reg Id and important detail of the applicant should not be audited.

-   Exception :

    -   Any exception occurred during the pre-registration data sync, the same will be reported to the registartion client in a understandable exception.


**Out of scope are -**

- Key management for decrypting JSON.

- decrypting the demograpgic JSON object and uploaded document and stored it in database and send as zip.

**NFRs -**

1.  Pre registration would expose Datasynch service. this is REST over HTTPS.

2. Registration client would call the service

3. the result would be fetched from DB and zipped information delivered.

4. security architecture would depict the security scenarios other than HTTPS.


1. :multiple clients and pre registration is source of data.

2.  registration client should be online to get the data.

3.  NO intermidiate server to suport mobility of registration client.

4.  HTTPS provides end point security.

 

**Solution**

**Reterive all pre-registration Ids :**

-   Create a REST API as '/datasync' GET Method, accept the Data Sync JSON object  from the registration-client application portal.

- The JSON object contains Registration Center ID, Date Range(Start Date, End Date) for the List of Pre-Registrations, User ID( Registration Officer/Supervisor). 

- The System will generate a Transaction ID and  fetch all the Pre-Registrations within the Date Range(Start Range, End Date) and for the Registration Center ID received.

-  The System will calculate the count of the Pre-Registration IDs being sent.

-  The System will send the List of Pre-Registration Ids, count of Pre-Registrations and transaction id in response entity .

-   Audit the exception/start/exit of the each stages of the data sync mechanism using AuditManager component.

**Reterive Pre-Registartions:**

-   Create a REST Service as '/datasync' GET Method, accept the list of pre-registartion ids from the registration-client application portal.

- The System will generate a Transaction ID and do the following operation need to be happen for each pre-registartion ids:

	 Step1: fetch all the demographic JSON object and appointment date time and decrypt JSON object , if successful go to next step otherwise throw an exception.

	 Step2: fetch all the document and decrypt it, if successful go to next step otherwise throw an exception.

	 Step3: preapre a zip file and ResponseDTO.{zip file structure need to discuss}

-   Audit the exception/start/exit of the each stages of the data sync mechanism using AuditManager component.

**Success / Error Code** 
   - While processing the Pre-Registration if there is any error or successfully then send the respective success or error code to the UI from API layer as  Response object.

  Code   |       Type  | Message|
-----|----------|-------------|
  0000      |             Success |   Packet Successfully created


**Dependency Modules**

Component Name | Module Name | Description | 
-----|----------|-------------|
  Audit Manager     |   Kernel        |    To audit the process while data sync.
  Exception Manager  |  Kernel     |       To prepare the user defined exception and render to the user.
  Log        |          Kernel         |   To log the process.
  Database Access   |    Kernel      |      To get the database connectivity
