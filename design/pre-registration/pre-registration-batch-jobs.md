# Approach for Pre-Registration Batch Jobs

**Background**
- The Pre-Registration system should support Batch job for the following Activities.

	- Updating the status from **Booked** to **Expired**.
	- Updating the status to **Processed** after Reverse Data sync.
	- Archival for the **Processed** Pre-Registrations.
	- Syncing Appointment Availability per Registration center from Master Data.

The target users are -
   - Pre-Registration system

**Solution**

**Updating the status from Booked to Expired:**

-   Create a spring batch to update the status from booked to expired status once the appointment date is expired.

- The System will run a Batch Job at a certain dateTime from configuration  to update all the Pre-Registration's status on that day..

- Reterive all pre-registration entity  which are expired from the current date to the appoiment date.

- Update each reterived pre-registration entity's status code to **expired**.

**Updating the status to Processed after Reverse Data sync:**

-   Create a spring batch to update the status from booked to Processed status once the data received from registration processor.

- The System will run a Batch Job at a certain dateTime from configuration  to update all the Pre-Registration's status on that day.

- Reterive all processed pre-registration-id-list entity which are from last processed date to till date.

- Reterive pre-registration entity from the pre-registration id of each pre-registration-id-list entity.

- Update each reterived pre-registration entity's status code to **Processed**.

**Archival for the Processed Pre-Registrations:**

-   Create a spring batch to archival for the **Processed** Pre-Registrations.

- The System will run a Batch Job at a certain dateTime from configuration  to archival all the **Processed** Pre-Registrations on that day.

- Reterive all pre-registration entity which are in **processed** status to till date and delete from the **applicant_demographic** table.

- Insert pre-registration entity to **proccessed_pre_registration** table.

**Syncing appointment availability per Registration center from Master Data:**

-   Create a spring batch to archival for the Syncing Appointment Availability per Registration center from Master Data.

- The System will run a Batch Job at a certain dateTime from configuration  to syncing appointment availability per registration center.

- Call the master data service to retrieve all the registration centers. In the response system will receive the Registartion center Id, working hours, processing time, holiday code, number of kiosks. Insert into the **registartion_center_details** table.

- Call the master data service for holiday details by providing the holiday code. system will receive all holiday date associated with that holiday code.

- Calculate the time slots based on the proceesing time for the day and insert in the **registartion_center_time_slots** table.

- link the **registartion_center_details** and **registartion_center_time_slots** tables with the registartion center id.
